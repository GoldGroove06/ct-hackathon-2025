# Vaahan-Saarthi üöóüõ£Ô∏è

**Tagline: Aapke Safar ka Digital Rakshak.**

Vaahan-Saarthi is a deep-learning-based computer vision project designed to automate the detection of road anomalies like potholes from video feeds...

### üßê Problem Statement

In India, over 11,000 road accidents annually are attributed to potholes, and due to potholes, our vehicles encounter alignment challenges and high anually maintainence and repair cost...

---

### ‚ú® Our Solution

Vaahan-Saarthi is the first and most critical step to solve these problems. Our system takes a video feed (e.g., from a vehicle's dashcam), processes it, and automatically identifies and marks potholes..

**Current Functionality:**
* **Input:** Accepts standard video file formats.
* **Processing:** Utilizes a fine-tuned YOLOv8l model to perform object detection on each frame.
* **Output:** Generates a processed video file with bounding boxes drawn around all detected potholes.

### ‚úÖ Core Problems Solved

Our model currently provides a robust solution to the foundational challenges of vehicle maintainence and accidents:

1.Reduces the Accident Rate : Our Vaahan-Saarthi will reduce the number of accident cases...which occurs due to potholes and cracks on roads
2.Reduces the vehicle's   maintainence and repair cost : Our Vaahan-Saarthi will drastically reduce the vehicle's   maintainence and repair cost.
3.Overcomes the limitation of Cruise control feature in Indian brand cars : Our Vaahan-Saarthi will overcome the limitation of this feature...

### üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack & Reasoning

* **Language: Python:** The industry standard for AI/ML due to its extensive libraries and rapid development capabilities.
* **Detection Model: YOLOv8l (Large):** Chosen for its state-of-the-art performance, offering an optimal balance between high accuracy and real-time processing speed. The 'large' version ensures higher precision in detection.
* **Video Processing: OpenCV:** A powerful, optimized library used for all core video manipulation tasks, including frame extraction, drawing bounding boxes, and re-compiling the video.
* **Data Manipulation: NumPy:** Used for efficient, high-performance numerical operations on image arrays in the backend.
* **File Handling: OS Module:** For reliable management of input and output file paths.

### üöÄ Future Scope

Our vision for Vaahan-Saarthi extends far beyond detection. Our roadmap includes:

1.  **Real-time GIS Mapping:** Integrating with GPS data to plot detected anomalies on a live city map.
2.  **Automated Reporting System:** Developing a dashboard for municipal corporations to receive real-time alerts and reports.
3.  **All-Weather, 24/7 Capability:** Training the model with night-time, rainy, and other adverse condition datasets to ensure round-the-clock functionality.
